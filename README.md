# nodeJsNotesProject

Welcome to the `nodeJsNotesProject`! This repository contains a basic implementation of a notes management system using Express.js. As a student, your goal is to understand the structure, and complete the code following the same structure

## Overview

The project is structured around a single Express route module that allows users to:
- View all notes
- View a specific note by ID
- Create a new note
- Update a note by ID
- Delete a note by ID

Data for the notes is stored in a local JSON file named `notes.json`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your system

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CodersArkX/nodeJsNotesProject.git
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
## Understanding the Code

Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

### Setting up modules and router
inside the routes folder there is **notesRoutes.js** file u will find a basic structure of all requests that we will need so the goal is to complete it 

## Exemples 
#### Viewing All Notes
for exemple here u will need to implemente the logic to get all notes 
   ```bash
   router.get('/', ...);
   ```


## Last and not least 
Remember, understanding and modifying a codebase is a crucial skill for a developer. This is a foundational project to get you started on that journey. Dive in and happy coding! ðŸš€
